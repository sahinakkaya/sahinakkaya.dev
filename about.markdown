Hi, my name is **Şahin Akkaya**. I am a Computer Engineer graduated
from [ITU][itu]. I am a Free Software enthusiast, Python lover and 
perfectionist. I like to tinker things until they are *just right*. 
I also believe there is no such thing as perfect so I never stop. 
I will do my best to make things better and I love doing it so far.

Subscribe to my <a href="/feed.xml"><i class="fas fa-fw fa-rss-square" aria-hidden="true"></i>RSS Feed</a> for most recent gems like this
(kidding). But I can still give you three good reason to subscribe:
1. You are here. Reading something on my website. So you wonder about
me.
2. I did literally nothing to set up the feed. It is built in to
[Jekyll][jekyll].
3. RSS is the best thing in the world. Why not?

My life didn’t change that much. Actually, it is getting worse.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The biggest problem of my life is the graduation project. Oh, God it is making me sick! I simply don’t have any interest for the subject I am supposed to work on. One part of me saying that “come on, you came this far. You are nearly finished. One last push!” and other part of me saying “oh no, don’t do it. You have never done something you don’t like in your entire life. F*ck it!”. So I am wasting my time each term with the dilemma I just described. I really don’t know what to do. This thing is f’ed up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second biggest problem is I live in Turkey. I feel like all my friends somehow get rid of this sh*thole and I am locked here. I use Twitter and Reddit to consume daily news and almost everyday I encounter something that make me say “F*ck me, why I am still here? There is no hope”. Actually, the situation was much worse while I was following pages that shares “street interviews”. At first I started watching them &lt;em&gt;for fun&lt;/em&gt; but the stupidity of people was real and harming my mental health. Since that day, I started consuming only news. My experience got better but I feel like it is still affecting me in a bad manner because everyday something bad happens and there is not much I can do to fix. Today, I decided to delete Twitter and Reddit. I’ll see how it goes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am living with my parents for the past 6 months, I break up with my girlfriend, I left the place I was working. Man, this could be the worst year of my life!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;assets/images/recap-2022/jackie-chan-wtf.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Jackie Chan WTF meme&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You know what? I am not gonna give up. &lt;em&gt;“… It ain’t about how hard you get hit. It’s about how hard you get hit and keep moving forward. How much you can take, and keep moving forward…”&lt;/em&gt; No, seriously things really will be different for me in 2023 I can feel it. I learn from my mistakes, they are making me even more perfect :D I love myself, I got this.&lt;/p&gt;

that they are making Github Copilot available for everyone. Previously, it was in Beta and you could get it through the waiting list.
When I saw the news, I thought I can give it a try. But not so surprisingly it was not free. You have 3 ways to get it:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Pay the subscription fee and get it.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Prove you are a student and get it for free.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Be a maintainer of &lt;em&gt;a popular repository&lt;/em&gt; and get it for free.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think I should be able to use it for free because I am a student but apparently they are not convinced yet. Anyways, that is a different
story. I don’t care if they will give me access to Github Copilot or not. It is not a big deal for me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But some people were really angry about how Github Team being vague while defining the criteria as “being a maintainer of a popular open source project”.
I think they are right to some extent. If all you need is having a few thousands stars for a project, you could easily get that. I know a lot of troll 
or low effort repositories that get a lot of stars because they are funny.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Later, I found &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/fatih/status/1539574219629105156&quot;&gt;another tweet&lt;/a&gt; that explains how Github decides what is &lt;em&gt;popular&lt;/em&gt;. According to 
this tweet, if you have a repository that is in top 1000 in one of the most popular 34 languages, you are eligible to get Github Copilot for free. 
This is better than the previous definition but you can still argue that it is not fair because one can create a package for checking if a number is
even or not and get thousands of stars.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can criticize this, I get that. But do not come up with silly arguments to justify yourself. Like how on earth would you think that Github is doing 
something bad because $10/month is too much for this service? It is business man, you pay if you think it is worth it. That’s it. &lt;em&gt;“I joined beta program
and it was free, now they want to charge me if I want to continue using it. They did not tell me that.”&lt;/em&gt; Uhhm… What? Are you aware that what you are using
is another company’s service and they have all rights to do whatever they want with their service? How you guys even can build up arguments like that?! This is crazy!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some people argue that &lt;em&gt;“what Github is doing is wrong because they used open source projects &lt;strong&gt;without consent&lt;/strong&gt;.”&lt;/em&gt; Another similar argument is that &lt;em&gt;“what 
Github is doing is evil because they used projects developed by community and now they are selling it without giving any money to the contributors of 
these projects.”&lt;/em&gt; Do you guys even have an idea what licenses stands for? If you don’t want to some random person use your code, just license it that 
way. And if you licensed it with a GPL compatible or similar license you already gave rights anyone to use or sell your code. That is not Github’s 
problem. That is your problem not understanding how licenses work. Stop complaining.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Şahin Akkaya</name></author><category term="copilot" /><category term="license" /><category term="github" /><summary type="html">Recently, Github announced that they are making Github Copilot available for everyone.

&lt;p&gt;Last week, I received an email from &lt;a href=&quot;https://letsencrypt.org/&quot;&gt;Let’s Encrypt&lt;/a&gt; reminding me to renew my certificates. I forgot to renew it and the certificate expired. Now I can’t send or receive any emails. If you send me email in the last week and wonder why I didn’t respond, this is the reason.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, I thought it will be easy to fix. Just run &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;certbot&lt;/code&gt; again and let him do the job, right? NOPE. It is not that easy. It is just giving me errors with some success messages. If I was not so clueless about what the heck I am doing, I could fix the error. But I don’t know anything about how SSL works and it is a shame.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don’t even know the subject enough to Google it. I feel like I am the only guy in the planet whose certificate is expired. Seriously, how tf I can’t find a solution to a such common problem? There was a saying like, &lt;em&gt;“If you can’t find something on the internet, there is a high chance that you are being stupid”&lt;/em&gt;. It was not exactly like this but I can’t find the original quote either. Argghh…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you know the original quote, email me… No, do not email because it does not work. F%ck this thing. F*%k everything. I deserved this. Do not help. If I can’t fix this by myself, I should not call myself computer engineer. I am out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;update&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem is fixed. One of my colleagues told me to reboot the server so that it will (&lt;em&gt;possibly&lt;/em&gt;) trigger a script to get a new certificate. I did not think it would work because I already try to get a new certificate manually running &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;certbot renew&lt;/code&gt;. And yeah, it didn’t change anything but gave me courage to try other &lt;em&gt;dead simple&lt;/em&gt; solutions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One of them was adding missing MX records for my domain. &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;certbot&lt;/code&gt; was telling me that it can’t find any &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;A&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;AAAA&lt;/code&gt; records for &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;www.mail&lt;/code&gt;. I didn’t think this is related with my problem because how would I receive emails before then? Anyway, I added the records and the errors are gone. It was only giving me success messages now. Everything seemed to be fine. But I still could not connect to my mail account.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And here is the solution: &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;sudo systemctl restart dovecot&lt;/code&gt;. Kill me. I am &lt;em&gt;guessing&lt;/em&gt; I had to restart the mail service because certificate has changed and it had to pick up the new one. I bet if I had run this command right after &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;certbot renew&lt;/code&gt; I would not face any issues. The error messages caused by missing mx records were not related with this problem but I was confused by them and I thought something wrong with my certificates.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any way, I am happy that it is finally fixed. Did I learn something from this? Not much. But yeah, sometimes all you need is a simple restart :D&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Şahin Akkaya</name></author><category term="ssl" /><summary type="html">A failure story Last week, I received an email from Let’s Encrypt reminding me to renew my certificates.

But it usually happens. When I reboot, I find myself in the “Grub rescue” menu and I don’t know how to fix things from that point.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I go into the live environment and run some random commands that I found on the internet and hope for the best.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/grub-rescue/random-bullshit.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;me trying to fix grub&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What a nice way to shoot myself in the foot! But this time is different. This time, I f*cked up so much that even the random commands on the internet could not help me. I was on my own and I needed to figure out what is wrong with my system. Let me tell you what I did:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I decided to install another OS just to try it in a real machine. I wanted to shrink one of my partitions to create a space for the new system. I run &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;fdisk /dev/sdb&lt;/code&gt;, the very first message that it tells me was&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;This disk is currently in use - repartitioning is probably a bad idea. It's recommended to umount all file systems, and swapoff all swap partitions on this disk.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes, it just screams &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;“Do not do it!”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; but come on. I will not try to shrink the partition I am using (&lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;sdb3&lt;/code&gt;). So it should not be a problem. I ignored the message and shrink it anyway. No problem. Installed and tested the new OS a little bit. Time to reboot and hope for the best. And of course it did not boot. What would I even expecting?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/grub-rescue/cj.png&quot; alt=&quot;ah sh*t here we go again&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As always, I booted into a live environment and run &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;boot-repair&lt;/code&gt; command. It was always working but this time… Even after finishing the operation successfully I could not boot into neither Arch nor Ubuntu (the two systems I had previously).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Arch was originally mounted in &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;sdb3&lt;/code&gt; and Ubuntu was in &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;sda2&lt;/code&gt;. Considering the fact that I only messed with &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;sdb&lt;/code&gt;, I should be able to boot Ubuntu, right? Well, yeah. Technically I did boot into Ubuntu but I didn’t see the login screen. It was dropping me into something called &lt;em&gt;“Emergency mode”&lt;/em&gt; which just makes me panic! &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;sudo update-grub&lt;/code&gt;… Nope. Nothing changes. Arch does not boot and Ubuntu partially boots.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let me tell you what the problem was and how my ignorance made it worse:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;While installing the new system, I saw a partition &lt;strong&gt;labelled&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;“Microsoft Basic Data”&lt;/em&gt;. I deleted it thinking it is not required because I don’t use W*ndows. It turns out, it was my &lt;em&gt;boot&lt;/em&gt; partition for Arch, just labelled incorrectly… Big lolz :D But we will see this is not even important because I had to rewrite my boot partition anyway.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;My Arch was installed in &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;sdb3&lt;/code&gt;. When I created a new partition and installed the new system, &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;sdb3&lt;/code&gt; was shifted to &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;sdb5&lt;/code&gt; even though I did not ask for it. But the grub configuration to boot my system was still pointing to &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;sdb3&lt;/code&gt;. That was the reason why Arch does not boot. It was trying to boot from &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;sdb3&lt;/code&gt;. So I had to recreate grub configuration and reinstall grub to fix it. I run the following commands that I found &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.jeremymorgan.com/tutorials/linux/how-to-reinstall-boot-loader-arch-linux/&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; in a live Arch environment:
    &lt;div class=&quot;language-bash highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;mkdir&lt;/span&gt; /mnt/arch
mount &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;-t&lt;/span&gt; auto /dev/sdb5 /mnt/arch
arch-chroot /mnt/arch
mount &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;-t&lt;/span&gt; auto /dev/sdb4 /boot/efi
os-prober
grub-mkconfig &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; /boot/grub/grub.cfg
grub-install &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;--efi-directory&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;/boot/efi &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;--target&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;x86_64-efi /dev/sdb
&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;exit
&lt;/span&gt;reboot
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;    &lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;And it fixed my grub. I can now boot into Arch, hooray!&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ubuntu was not still booting properly. I checked the logs with &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;journalctl -xb&lt;/code&gt; and saw something related with &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;sdb&lt;/code&gt;. Ubuntu was installed in &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;sda2&lt;/code&gt;, why &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;sdb&lt;/code&gt; should be a problem? Then I remembered something. Back in times when I was using Ubuntu, I was using &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;sdb1&lt;/code&gt; as a secondary storage. So I had a configuration where it automatically mounts &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;sdb1&lt;/code&gt; on startup. Since I messed with &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;sdb1&lt;/code&gt; , it was failing to mount it. I opened &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;/etc/fstab&lt;/code&gt;, and deleted the related line. Bingo! It started booting properly.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/grub-rescue/hackerman.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;i am something of a hackerman myself&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I started feeling like Hackerman, and I said to myself &lt;em&gt;“You know what, Imma fix everything.”&lt;/em&gt; I had a very sh*tty grub menu with useless grub entries from old systems that I don’t use anymore. The UEFI also had the same problem. It had ridiculous amount of boot entries that most of them are just trash.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/grub-rescue/shitty-uefi.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;the pictures i took while trying to figure out which boot options are useless&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;These are the pictures I took for reference while trying to figure out which boot options are useless. Sorry for the bad quality. I didn’t think I would use them in a blog post.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;While trying to fix the previous problems, I’ve spent enough time in the &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;/boot/efi&lt;/code&gt; directory that make me understand where these grub entries are coming from. There were a lot of files belong to old systems. I simply deleted them and updated grub. All of the bad entries were gone. I want to draw your attention here: &lt;em&gt;I did not search for how to delete the unused grub entries. I just knew deleting their directories from &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;/boot/efi&lt;/code&gt; will do the job. I am doing this sh*t! (Another hackerman moment :D )&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;In order to delete useless boot options from UEFI menu, I used &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;efibootmgr&lt;/code&gt;. I searched for it on the internet, of course!
        &lt;div class=&quot;language-bash highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;efibootmgr &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;-v&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;c&quot;&gt;# Check which entries you want to delete, say it is 0003.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;sudo &lt;/span&gt;efibootmgr &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;-b&lt;/span&gt; 0003 &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;-B&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;c&quot;&gt;# This will delete third boot option. &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;        &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And finally! I know everything about how all these work. Another shady part of Linux is clear for me. Now:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In my &lt;a href=&quot;/2022/02/26/ssh-into-machine-that-is-behind-private-network.html&quot;&gt;previous post&lt;/a&gt;, I explained how to do port forwarding to access some machine behind private network. I will use this method to fix some issues in our desktop at home or my girlfriend’s computer. Now, of course I don’t want to give them access to my server. But they also need to have a user in my server to be able to perform port forwarding via ssh. So I wanted to create a user with least privileges to make sure nothing goes wrong.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-solution&quot;&gt;The solution&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I searched the problem in it turned out to be very simple. You just need to add two additional flags to &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;adduser&lt;/code&gt; command while creating the user.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;language-bash highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;sudo &lt;/span&gt;adduser uselessuser &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;--shell&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;/bin/false &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;--no-create-home&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;uselessuser&lt;/code&gt; can’t do anything useful in your server. If they try to login, the connection will be closed immediately.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;language-bash highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;❯ ssh uselessuser@remote.host
uselessuser@remote.host&lt;span class=&quot;se&quot;&gt;\'&lt;/span&gt;s password:
Could not chdir to home directory /home/uselessuser: No such file or directory
Connection to remote.host closed.
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But they can still do forward the remote port to their local machine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;language-bash highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;❯ ssh &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;-Nf&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;-R&lt;/span&gt; 7777:localhost:22 uselessuser@remote.host
uselessuser@remote.host&lt;span class=&quot;se&quot;&gt;\'&lt;/span&gt;s password:
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;-N&lt;/code&gt; option is the most important one here. From the documentation:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;div class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt; -N   Do not execute a remote command.  This is useful 
      for just forwarding ports.   Refer to the description 
      of SessionType in ssh_config(5) for details.
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;last-words&quot;&gt;Last words&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I love learning new things everyday. I knew setting the shell of a user to &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;/bin/false&lt;/code&gt; will prevent them from logging in. The reason I wrote this blog post is because 2 things I wanted to share:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;While looking for a solution to the problem I mentioned, I searched &lt;em&gt;“create a user with no privileges in linux”&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://askubuntu.com/questions/1174376/how-to-create-a-user-with-the-least-privileges-permissions-but-enough-to-do-ssh&quot;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; came out. It is really interesting for me that another person wanted to do the same thing for the &lt;em&gt;exact same reasons&lt;/em&gt;. They were also trying port forwarding via ssh and they wanted to create a limited user in their server to give friends. So the question was a &lt;strong&gt;perfect fit&lt;/strong&gt;  to the problem.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;-N&lt;/code&gt; flag of the ssh command was also surprising for me. It was like as if someone had encountered these problems before and just took the exact steps required to solve this problem for me. I mean look at the documentation. Crazy!&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I believe there is always a “tech support person” in every home. Everyone knows that when there is a problem with any electronic device, they should ask this person. I am the tech support in our house. Today, I had to fix a problem in our desktop. Since I was not at home, I had to fix the problem remotely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;possible-solutions&quot;&gt;Possible solutions&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Just tell the non-tech people at home to configure the router to forward ssh traffic to desktop, right? Well, this is not an option for me, not because people are non-tech, but there is no router! The desktop is connected to internet via hotspot from mobile phone. There is no root access in the phone and even if there was, it is a really big pain to forward the packets manually. Trust me. Been there, done that!&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There are tools like &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ngrok.com&quot;&gt;ngrok&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;localtunnel.me&quot;&gt;localtunnel&lt;/a&gt; which exposes your localhost to the internet and gives you a URL to access it but I did not want to use them.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;I did not want to use &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;ngrok&lt;/code&gt; because it is not open source and it might have security issues. They are also charging you.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;localtunnel&lt;/code&gt; seemed perfect. The code of both client and server is open. That is great news! But it did not last long because it is just forwarding http/https traffic :(&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;solution&quot;&gt;Solution&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was thinking of extending the functionality of &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;localtunnel&lt;/code&gt;, but I learned a very simple way. You don’t need any external program to overcome this issue. The good old &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;ssh&lt;/code&gt; can do that! All you need is another machine (a remote server) that both computers can access via ssh.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-bash highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c&quot;&gt;# local machine (my home computer)&lt;/span&gt;
ssh &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;-R&lt;/span&gt; 7777:localhost:22 remote-user@remote.host
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This command forwards all the incoming connections to port 7777 of remote machine to port 22 of our current machine. In order for this to work, you need to make sure &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;GatewayPorts&lt;/code&gt; is set to &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;yes&lt;/code&gt; in the remote server ssh configuration. It also assumes our current machine accepts ssh connections via port 22.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, go to any machine and connect to the remote server first. When we are connected, we will create another ssh connection to port 7777 to connect our home computer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;language-bash highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c&quot;&gt;# another local machine (my laptop)&lt;/span&gt;
ssh remote-user@remote.host

&lt;span class=&quot;c&quot;&gt;# connected remote&lt;/span&gt;
ssh &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;-p&lt;/span&gt; 7777 homeuser@localhost 
&lt;span class=&quot;c&quot;&gt;# we are now connected to home computer&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The last two command can also combined so that we directly hop into the home computer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;language-bash highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;ssh &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;-t&lt;/span&gt; remote-user@remote.host ssh &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;-p&lt;/span&gt; 7777 homeuser@localhost 
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;result&quot;&gt;Result&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a result, it only took us 2 simple ssh commands to do this. This is just unbelievable! Now, I need to find a way to make non-tech people at home run this command when there is a problem. Too bad Linux can’t help me there :D&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Şahin Akkaya</name></author><category term="ssh" /><category term="private-network" /><category term="remote-port-forwarding" /><summary type="html">Story I believe there is always a “tech support person” in every home.

&lt;p&gt;Today, I have recorded a video for one of my classes and I was required to upload it till midnight. The video was perfect except for a few seconds where I misspelled some words and started again. I had to remove that part from the video before uploading it. Since I was low on time, I thought that I better use a GUI program to do this job. I opened up &lt;a href=&quot;https://kdenlive.org/en/&quot;&gt;Kdenlive&lt;/a&gt; and jumped into editing my video. It was my first time using it so I spent some time to cut and delete the parts that I want to get rid of. When I was ready, I clicked Render button to render my video. It was waaay too slow than I expected. Since I have nothing to do while waiting for render to finish, I thought I could give &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;ffmpeg&lt;/code&gt; a shot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;let-the-show-begin&quot;&gt;Let the show begin&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like Kdenlive, I have never used &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;ffmpeg&lt;/code&gt; before. Like every normal Linux user do, I opened up a terminal and typed &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;man ffmpeg&lt;/code&gt; to learn how to use it… Just kidding :D I opened a browser and typed &lt;em&gt;“ffmpeg cut video by time”&lt;/em&gt;. Not the best search query, but it was good enough to find what I am looking for as the &lt;a href=&quot;https://stackoverflow.com/questions/18444194/cutting-the-videos-based-on-start-and-end-time-using-ffmpeg&quot;&gt;first result&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;cutting-the-videos-based-on-start-and-end-time&quot;&gt;Cutting the videos based on start and end time&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to answers on the page I mentioned, I run the following commands to cut my video into two parts:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;language-bash highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;ffmpeg &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;-ss&lt;/span&gt; 00:00:00 &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;-to&lt;/span&gt; 00:01:55  &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;-i&lt;/span&gt; input.mov &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;-c&lt;/span&gt; copy part1.mp4 &lt;span class=&quot;c&quot;&gt;# take from 00:00 to 01:55&lt;/span&gt;
ffmpeg &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;-ss&lt;/span&gt; 00:02:03 &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;-to&lt;/span&gt; 00:05:17  &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;-i&lt;/span&gt; input.mov &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;-c&lt;/span&gt; copy part2.mp4 &lt;span class=&quot;c&quot;&gt;# take from 02:03 to 05:17&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These two commands run &lt;strong&gt;instantly&lt;/strong&gt;! Kdenlive was still rendering… The progress was 46%. Meh… I said “Duck it, I am gonna use ffmpeg only” and cancelled the rendering.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;concatenating-the-video-files&quot;&gt;Concatenating the video files&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now we have two videos that we want to join. Guess what will be our next search query? &lt;em&gt;“ffmpeg join videos”&lt;/em&gt;. And &lt;a href=&quot;https://stackoverflow.com/questions/7333232/how-to-concatenate-two-mp4-files-using-ffmpeg&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; is the first result:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-bash highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;echo &lt;/span&gt;file part1.mp4 &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; mylist.txt
&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;echo &lt;/span&gt;file part2.mp4 &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; mylist.txt
ffmpeg &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;-f&lt;/span&gt; concat &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;-i&lt;/span&gt; mylist.txt &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;-c&lt;/span&gt; copy result.mp4
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And we are DONE! How easy was that? Whole process took about 10 minutes including my search on the internet. If I continued waiting for Kdenlive to finish rendering, I would probably be still waiting at that time. I love the power of command line!&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Şahin Akkaya</name></author><category term="cli" /><category term="ffmpeg" /><summary type="html">Story Today, I have recorded a video for one of my classes and I was required to upload it till midnight.

I am going to automate the deployment of this site but you can do whatever you want. Just understanding the basics will be enough.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;introduction-to-github-actions-and-webhooks&quot;&gt;Introduction to GitHub Actions and Webhooks&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let me start by explaining what are GitHub Actions and GitHub Webhooks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Github Actions&lt;/strong&gt; is a continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) platform that allows you to automate your build, test, and deployment pipeline. You can create workflows that build and test every pull request to your repository, or deploy merged pull requests to production.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Webhooks&lt;/strong&gt; provide a way for notifications to be delivered to an external web server whenever certain actions occur on a repository or organization. … For example, you can configure a webhook to execute whenever:&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;A repository is pushed to&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;A pull request is opened&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;A GitHub Pages site is built&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;A new member is added to a team&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;defining-the-problem-and-solution&quot;&gt;Defining the problem and solution&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I said, my example will be automating the deployment of this site. Here is the normal workflow of me doing it manually:
&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/gh-actions-and-webhooks/workflow.png&quot; alt=&quot;My workflow&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you can see, the only place where my work is really required is writing the post. Other two steps can be automated. We will use GitHub Actions to generate the site content and Webhooks to let our server know about the new content so it can pull the changes. Let’s get started.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;setting-up-github-actions&quot;&gt;Setting up GitHub Actions&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Setting up a GitHub Action is as easy as creating a &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;.yml&lt;/code&gt; file in &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;.github/workflows/&lt;/code&gt; directory in your repository. Let us create a new action to build our site. Fortunately, there is already a &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/marketplace/actions/jekyll-actions&quot;&gt;GitHub action&lt;/a&gt; to do it for us. Create a file called &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;.github/workflows/jekyll.yml&lt;/code&gt; in your root directory of your repository and put the following contents:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;language-yaml highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pi&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;Jekyll site CI&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;on&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pi&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;push&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pi&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;branches&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pi&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;pi&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;main&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;pi&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;pull_request&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pi&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;branches&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pi&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;pi&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;main&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;pi&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;jobs&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pi&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;build&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pi&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;runs-on&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pi&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;ubuntu-latest&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;steps&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pi&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;pi&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;uses&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pi&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;actions/checkout@v2&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class=&quot;pi&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pi&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;Jekyll Actions&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;uses&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pi&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;helaili/jekyll-action@2.2.0&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;with&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pi&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;token&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pi&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}&lt;/span&gt; 
        &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;keep_history&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pi&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;no&quot;&gt;true&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;target_branch&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pi&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;gh-pages'&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s it! We have created our first Action. When we push this change, GitHub will start building our site and push the result to &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;gh-pages&lt;/code&gt; branch. Currently, it will take a while to build because we don’t use caching. So let’s include it to build faster. Add the following piece as a second step:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;language-yaml highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;# Use GitHub Actions' cache to shorten build times and decrease load on servers&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;pi&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;uses&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pi&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;actions/cache@v2&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;with&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pi&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;path&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pi&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;vendor/bundle&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;key&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pi&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;${{ runner.os }}-gems-${{ hashFiles('**/Gemfile') }}&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;restore-keys&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pi&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;pi&quot;&gt;|&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;${{ runner.os }}-gems-&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are done with the Actions part. You can see the final code &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/Asocia/sahinakkayadotdev/blob/main/.github/workflows/jekyll.yml&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. When you are also done with the code, just push it to trigger the action.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;setting-up-the-webhook-and-related-endpoint&quot;&gt;Setting up the Webhook and related endpoint&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now that we set up our Action to build the site, we need to let our server know about the changes so that it can pull the changes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;creating-a-webhook-from-github&quot;&gt;Creating a Webhook from GitHub&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To add a Webhook, open your repository in browser and navigate to &lt;em&gt;‘Settings &amp;gt; Webhooks’&lt;/em&gt; and click &lt;em&gt;‘Add Webhook’&lt;/em&gt;. Fill in the form with appropriate values. Here is an example:
&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/gh-actions-and-webhooks/add-webhook.png&quot; alt=&quot;Webhook form example&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is all you have to do from GitHub. Now, whenever there is a &lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;push&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt; event to your repository, GitHub will send a POST request to your &lt;em&gt;payload url&lt;/em&gt; with the details.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;notice--info&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note:&lt;/strong&gt; Our Action is configured to push to a branch in our repository, so it will also trigger this hook and we will catch it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;creating-an-endpoint-to-handle-the-requests&quot;&gt;Creating an endpoint to handle the requests&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will use &lt;a href=&quot;https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.0.x/&quot;&gt;Flask&lt;/a&gt; framework to handle the post requests coming to our endpoint. You can use whatever programming language or framework you want. It will be very simple code with just one job: Validate the secret keys and run a specific code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s start by creating a new project and a virtual environment:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;language-bash highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;mdkir post_receiver
&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;cd &lt;/span&gt;post_receiver
python3 &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;-m&lt;/span&gt; venv venv
&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;source &lt;/span&gt;venv/bin/activate
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Install the required packages:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;language-bash highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;pip &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;install &lt;/span&gt;Flask gunicorn
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Create a new file for storing our environment variables:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;language-python highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;# config.py
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;APP_KEY&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;your-secret-key&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;# same key that is used in github while creating the webhook
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;PROJECT_PATH&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;/path/to/your/project/&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;# you will want to cd into this path and perform commands such as git pull etc.
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And create the Flask application:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;language-python highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;# post_receiver.py
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;kn&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nn&quot;&gt;hashlib&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;kn&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nn&quot;&gt;hmac&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;kn&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nn&quot;&gt;subprocess&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;kn&quot;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nn&quot;&gt;flask&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kn&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Flask&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;request&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;kn&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nn&quot;&gt;config&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;application&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Flask&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;__name__&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;@&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;application&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;route&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;'/'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;methods&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;'GET'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;'POST'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;])&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;index&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;():&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;request&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;method&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;==&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;'GET'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;'OK'&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;elif&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;request&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;method&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;==&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;'POST'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;content&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;request&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;data&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;secret&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;bytes&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;config&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;APP_KEY&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;'utf-8'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;digester&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;hmac&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;secret&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;content&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;hashlib&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;sha256&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;calculated_signature&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;'sha256='&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;digester&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;hexdigest&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;actual_signature&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;request&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;headers&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;get&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;'X-Hub-Signature-256'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;calculated_signature&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;==&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;actual_signature&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;subprocess&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Popen&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;'./perform-git-pull.sh'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;config&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;PROJECT_PATH&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;])&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;'OK'&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;else&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;'Error'&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;__name__&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;==&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;__main__&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;application&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;run&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;host&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;'0.0.0.0'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will not go into details explaining what each line does. Basically, we are checking if the request is a POST request and if so we are comparing the secret keys to make sure that the request is coming from GitHub. In our case, this is not too important because when the keys match we are running simple git commands in our repository but you might need it if you are doing something more complicated. And here is the contents of &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;perform-git-pull.sh&lt;/code&gt; file:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;language-bash highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c&quot;&gt;#!/bin/bash&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;cd&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;$1&lt;/span&gt;
git checkout gh-pages
git pull
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are almost done! All we need to do is create a service to automatically run our code and let nginx handle our endpoint correctly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Create a new file &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;post_receiver.service&lt;/code&gt; in &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;/etc/systemd/system/&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;#/etc/systemd/system/post_receiver.service

# change &amp;lt;user&amp;gt; to your actual username
[Unit]
Description=post_receiver
After=network.target multi-user.target

[Service]
User=&amp;lt;user&amp;gt;
Environment=&quot;PYTHONPATH=/home/&amp;lt;user&amp;gt;/post_receiver/venv/bin/python&quot;
WorkingDirectory=/home/&amp;lt;user&amp;gt;/post_receiver
ExecStart=/home/&amp;lt;user&amp;gt;/post_receiver/venv/bin/gunicorn -b 127.0.0.1:5000 -w 2 --log-file /home/&amp;lt;user&amp;gt;/post_receiver/post_receiver.log post_receiver

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Make sure port &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;5000&lt;/code&gt; is reachable from outside.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;language-bash highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;sudo &lt;/span&gt;ufw allow 5000
&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;sudo &lt;/span&gt;ufw &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;enable&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, edit your nginx configuration, &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;/etc/nginx/sites-available/yoursite&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;location =  /postreceive/ {
    proxy_pass          http://localhost:5000/;
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Start, restart the services&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;language-bash highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;sudo &lt;/span&gt;systemctl daemon-reload
&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;sudo &lt;/span&gt;systemctl start post_receiver
&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;sudo &lt;/span&gt;systemctl &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;enable &lt;/span&gt;post_receiver
&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;sudo &lt;/span&gt;systemctl restart nginx
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s it! &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;curl https://yourdomain.com/postreceive/&lt;/code&gt; should return &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&quot;OK&quot;&lt;/code&gt; and we are ready to accept POST requests from GitHub.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;notes-for-debugging&quot;&gt;Notes for debugging&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In case anything goes wrong, here are a few tips to debug:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Every GitHub Action produces a log that you can examine. Check them to see if anything is odd.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;In the &lt;em&gt;Webhooks&lt;/em&gt; tab, there is a sub-tab called &lt;em&gt;Recent Deliveries&lt;/em&gt;. You can take a look at there to see the results of the requests from your hooks.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;You can always test your code locally with &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;curl&lt;/code&gt;:
    &lt;div class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;❯ curl -i -X POST -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '{&quot;foo&quot;: &quot;bar&quot;, &quot;bar&quot;: &quot;baz&quot;}' https://yourdomain.com/postreceive/
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;    &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m sure that you run a command something like above at least once if you are using terminal. You know how &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;cat&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;grep&lt;/code&gt; works and you also know what pipe (&lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;|&lt;/code&gt;) does. So you naturally combine all of these to make the job done. I was also doing it this way. What I didn’t know is that &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;grep&lt;/code&gt; already accepts file as an argument. So the above command could be rewritten as:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;language-bash highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;grep &lt;/span&gt;some_pattern some_file
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;… which can make you save a few keystrokes and a few nanoseconds of CPU cycles. Phew! Not a big deal if you are not working files that contains GBs of data, right? I agree but you should still use the latter command because it will help you solve some other problems better. Here is a real life scenario: You want to search for some specific pattern in all the files in a directory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;If you use the first approach, you may end up running commands like this:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-bash highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;❯ &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;ls&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;If you use the second approach, you will immediately realize that you can send all the files with &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;*&lt;/code&gt; operator and you will finish the job with just one command (2 if you include mandatory &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;ls&lt;/code&gt; :D):&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Isn’t this neat? You might say that &lt;em&gt;“This is cheating! You are using a wild card, of course it will be easier.”&lt;/em&gt; Well, yes. Technically I could use the same wild card in the first command like &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;cat * | grep light&lt;/code&gt; but:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I figured that out only after using wild card in the second command. So I think it is does not feel natural.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;It is still not giving the same output. Try and see the difference! &lt;a href=&quot;##&quot; title=&quot;You will not be able to see which file contains which line. 'cat' will just concatenate all the input.&quot;&gt;*&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

You know how cat and grep works and you also know what pipe (|) does. So you naturally combine all of these to make the job done. I was also doing it this way. What I didn’t know is that grep already accepts file as an argument. So the above command could be rewritten as: grep some_pattern some_file</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">First blog post</title><link href="https://sahinakkaya.dev/2021/12/24/first-blog-post.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="First blog post" /><published>2021-12-24T23:54:08+00:00</published><updated>2021-12-24T23:54:08+00:00</updated><id>https://sahinakkaya.dev/2021/12/24/first-blog-post</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://sahinakkaya.dev/2021/12/24/first-blog-post.html">&lt;style&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Hello, World!&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;##&quot; title=&quot;I think I just wrote the best first sentence I could write as a programmer :D&quot; class=&quot;cd&quot;&gt;&lt;sup class=&quot;ab&quot;&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
So here I am and welcome to my first blog. Having a personal space on the Internet has been a dream for me for years and I am happy that it finally have come true. You might think that I could sign-up for a social media platform and my profile would be a personal space for me but no. I just don’t feel comfortable with that way. This has been the case since my childhood and also the reason why I don’t use Facebook, Instagram or any other social media. If you think you found me on these platforms, I would say it is not me. I might write another post about why I don’t like social media but I will cut this one here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;why-i-wanted-to-start-blogging&quot;&gt;Why I wanted to start blogging?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are several reasons for starting my own site and blogging, but I can list the most important ones as follows:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;giving-back-to-community&quot;&gt;Giving back to community&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I use the software developed and brought by the community every day. The moment I power on my computer I start using Free Software. It really amazes me to see the work produced by people who do not know each other at all. For example, I did not even write a single line of code for this site. If Free Software didn’t exist, I’d either have to spend money and use a platform that I have limited control over, or waste my time and build a site with a possibly worse design than this one&lt;a href=&quot;##&quot; title=&quot;swh&quot; class=&quot;cd&quot;&gt;&lt;sup class=&quot;ab&quot;&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. In return for this, I want to give back to the community. For me, the way to give back to the community so far has been to share the projects I’ve done and archive the things I learn every day in a repository called &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/Asocia/til&quot;&gt;TIL&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;##&quot; title=&quot;Today I Learned&quot; class=&quot;cd&quot;&gt;&lt;sup class=&quot;ab&quot;&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. But some of the til’s I’ve written recently are getting lengthy and I think they deserve their own posts. So instead of writing long til’s, I will blog what I learned here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;archiving-the-memories&quot;&gt;Archiving the memories&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I like to go over what I have done in the past once in a while. Blogging is perfect way to do this. I still read my diaries that I wrote in the past and they are fun. But I promise I will keep these posts more formal than my diaries&lt;a href=&quot;##&quot; title=&quot;swh&quot; class=&quot;cd&quot;&gt;&lt;sup class=&quot;ab&quot;&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;pushing-myself-to-do-something-useful&quot;&gt;Pushing myself to do something useful&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the end of every year, I sit on my desk and think about what I did in that year. I generally don’t like the result because I fail to keep some of my resolutions for that year. Setting up a personal website was one of my resolutions for 2021 and it looks like I manage to keep it&lt;a href=&quot;##&quot; title=&quot;hooray!&quot; class=&quot;cd&quot;&gt;&lt;sup class=&quot;ab&quot;&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;##&quot; title=&quot;swh&quot; class=&quot;cd&quot;&gt;&lt;sup class=&quot;ab&quot;&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Unfortunately, I can’t always keep my spirits up. Sometimes I just do nothing and all the time passes. Hopefully, the feeling that I have to write something will help me get out of bad mood at such times.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;improving-my-writing-skills&quot;&gt;Improving my writing skills&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last but not least, I want to improve my writing. Even though I don’t use a formal language while writing here, I think it will help me improve my writing skills.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;final-words&quot;&gt;Final words&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While writing this post I already come up with some new topics to write but I think they need their own posts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Subscribe to my &lt;a href=&quot;/feed.xml&quot;&gt;&lt;i class=&quot;fas fa-fw fa-rss-square&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;RSS Feed&lt;/a&gt; to not miss them. You know RSS, right? I recently started using it and it is the best way to consume content. Do yourself a favor and search it if you don’t know. I will probably write something about it in the following blog posts. That’s all from me and thank you for reading. See you next time!&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Şahin Akkaya</name></author><summary type="html">Hello, World!* So here I am and welcome to my first blog.
